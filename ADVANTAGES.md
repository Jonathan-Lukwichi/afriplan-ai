## Advantages for Electrical Engineers

### ⏱️ Save 4-8 Hours Per Project

Manual quantity take-offs from drawings take hours of tedious counting. AfriPlan's AI extracts everything in **minutes**. Spend your time on design work, not counting symbols.

| Task | Manual | With AfriPlan |
|------|--------|---------------|
| 10-page residential | 4-6 hours | 5 minutes |
| 20-page commercial | 8-12 hours | 10 minutes |
| Complex multi-building | 2-3 days | 30 minutes |

---

### ✓ Reduce Counting Errors

Human counting is error-prone, especially on complex multi-page drawings. Common mistakes:
- Missing fixtures on crowded pages
- Double-counting across sheets
- Misreading symbols
- Forgetting entire rooms

AfriPlan provides **consistent, systematic extraction** across all pages with confidence scoring. The AI doesn't get tired or distracted.
